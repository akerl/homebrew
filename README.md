=================

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/halyard/homebrew-formulae/master.svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/halyard/homebrew-formulae)

These are my custom homebrew formulae. They're mostly just patched versions of the upstream homebrew ones, tweaked to suit my system.

To use, first tap the repo by running `brew tap halyard/homebrew-formulae` and then install programs using `brew install`.
