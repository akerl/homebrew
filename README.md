homebrew-formulae
=================

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/com/halyard/homebrew-formulae.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/halyard/homebrew-formulae)

These are my custom homebrew formulae. They're mostly just patched versions of the upstream homebrew ones, tweaked to suit my system.

To use, first tap the repo by running `brew tap halyard/homebrew-formulae` and then install programs using `brew install`.
